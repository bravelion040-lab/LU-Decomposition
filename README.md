# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm

1. Start the program and import the required libraries (numpy and LU-related functions from scipy.linalg).
   Accept the matrix (and vector, if needed) as input.
   
2. Convert the input values into NumPy arrays so that matrix operations can be performed easily.
  
3. Apply LU Decomposition:

    For L and U matrices → use lu()

    For solving equations → use lu_factor() and lu_solve()

4. Display the results:

     Print L and U matrices if the task is decomposition

     Print the solution vector X if the task is solving equations.

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix

## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
